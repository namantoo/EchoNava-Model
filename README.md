## Usage

The EchoNava model is designed to take audio input and return a sentiment score or classification. To use the model:

1. Ensure you have the required dependencies installed.
2. Load a pre-trained model using the provided scripts.
3. Pass your audio data to the model's prediction function.

Sample code will be provided once the model development progresses.

## Dataset

The model is trained on a curated dataset of audio clips, each labeled with one of the emotions: happy, sad, angry, neutral, etc. The dataset comprises 10,000 audio clips, each ranging from 5 to 10 seconds. The audio clips were sourced from various online repositories and underwent preprocessing to ensure consistent quality and format. Noise reduction and normalization techniques were applied to make the dataset suitable for training.

## Model Architecture

EchoNava employs a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture optimized for audio data. The model processes spectrogram images of the audio clips. The architecture includes:

- **Input Layer:** Accepts spectrogram images of size 128x128.
- **Convolutional Layers:** Multiple convolutional layers with varying filter sizes, followed by max-pooling layers.
- **Dense Layers:** Fully connected layers with dropout for regularization.
- **Output Layer:** A softmax layer that provides a probability distribution over the possible emotions.

Activation functions used include ReLU for hidden layers and softmax for the output layer.
